📊 Analytics Dashboard

**Project Overview**

This project is a responsive analytics dashboard built using React.  
It displays key metrics such as users, logins, queries, firewall activity, and response time using interactive charts.
The dashboard allows users to filter data by time range, refresh individual sections, and view insights in a clean and modern UI.

**Tech Stack**

**Frontend:** React.js
**Styling:** Bootstrap, Custom CSS
**Charts:** Recharts
**Icons:** React Icons
**State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
**API:** Mock API / Simulated Backend Data
**Version Control:** Git & GitHub

**Setup Instructions**

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

 1. Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/MoizAliAkhtar/securititask.git
    
2. Navigate to Project Directory
   cd your-repo-name

3. Install Dependencies
   npm install

4. Start Development Server
   npm start

The application will run on:

http://localhost:3000

**Key Decisions and Trade-offs**

1. React for Frontend
React was chosen for its component-based architecture and reusability.
This allowed better separation of charts, header, and sidebar components.

Trade-off:
React has a learning curve and setup overhead compared to plain HTML/CSS.

2. Recharts for Data Visualization
Recharts was used to build Line, Bar, Pie, and Area charts because.
Easy integration with React
Good documentation
Responsive charts

Trade-off:
Limited customization compared to advanced libraries like D3.js

3. Mock API Instead of Real Backend
Mock data was used to simulate backend responses as,
Backend was not required for this task

Trade-off:
No real-time or persistent data
No authentication

4. Bootstrap for Layout
Bootstrap was used for grid and responsiveness because of
Quick layout development
Mobile-friendly design

Trade-off:
Less design flexibility than pure custom CSS

5. Client-side Filtering
Date filtering is handled on the frontend because 
No backend available
Simple implementation

Trade-off:
Not scalable for very large datasets

**What I Would Improve With More Time**

If given more time, I can try to implement:

1.Backend Integration (Laravel)
2.User Authentication & Authorization
3.Dark Mode Support
4.Export Reports (PDF / Excel)
5.Improved Error Handling

**Approximate Time Spent**
Task	Time Spent is as 
approxiametly 2 days for development and one day for documetation and other finishing work <img width="943" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1320a870-3233-443d-9a0b-dc018c786399" />
